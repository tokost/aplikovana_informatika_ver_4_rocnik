You are an experienced programming tutor and I am a student asking you for help with my Python code.
- Answer my question as directly as possible. Then explain your answer at the level that a student in an introductory programming class can understand. Do NOT mention advanced concepts that students in an introductory class have not learned yet. Instead, use concepts that are taught in beginner-level programming tutorials.
- If you need to edit my code, make as few changes as needed in order to preserve as much of my original code as possible. Always add comments next to code that you edit to explain your changes at the level that a student in an introductory programming class can understand.
- Do NOT write code that uses advanced concepts or Python language features that students in an introductory programming class have not learned yet. Instead, try to use programming language features that are already present in my code. Also, prefer the Python standard library and built-in features over external libraries.

Here is my Python code, which uses Python 3.6:
```
pocitaj(5)
# 31
for i in 1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 16, 20, 32:
    print('pocitaj( {} ) = {}'.format(i, pocitaj(i)))

# Vysledok je :
# pocitaj( 1 ) = 1
# pocitaj( 2 ) = 3
# pocitaj( 3 ) = 7
# pocitaj( 8 ) = 255
# pocitaj( 10 ) = 1023
# pocitaj( 16 ) = 65535
# pocitaj( 20 ) = 1048575
# pocitaj( 32 ) = 4294967295
~~~ # line 15 <- error on this line, see below for error message
```

I see this error on line 15:
```
  File "<string>", line 15
    ~~~
      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```

Help me fix this error.

The error you're encountering seems to be related to the use of the tilde (~) character, which isn't appropriate in this context. To fix this error, you should remove the tilde character and any code that might be causing it. However, I noticed some inconsistencies in the code you provided. Let me fix these issues step by step.

Here is your modified code:

python
Copy code
def pocitaj(n):
    return (2 ** n) - 1  # Use the formula for generating the required sequence

# Test the function with the given values
pocitaj(5)
# 31

# Iterate through the specified values and print the results
for i in (1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 16, 20, 32):
    print('pocitaj( {} ) = {}'.format(i, pocitaj(i)))

# Vysledok je :
# pocitaj( 1 ) = 1
# pocitaj( 2 ) = 3
# pocitaj( 3 ) = 7
# pocitaj( 8 ) = 255
# pocitaj( 10 ) = 1023
# pocitaj( 16 ) = 65535
# pocitaj( 20 ) = 1048575
# pocitaj( 32 ) = 4294967295
In this code, the pocitaj function takes an argument n and returns the value computed based on the formula (2 ** n) - 1. This formula generates the required sequence. The for loop iterates through the specified values and prints the results using the format method.

The error has been fixed by removing the tilde character (~) from the code, as it was causing a syntax error.
